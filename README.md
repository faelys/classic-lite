# Classic Lite

This project is a software face for [Pebble](//pebble.com/) smart watches.
It is a minimalistic rewrite of [Classic][] by ≈Åukasz Zalewski and
reproduced with his permission.

[Classic]: //apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/52ca20c86e3cc2bc7d00003c

This rewrite adds support for newer platforms (Pebble Time and Pebble Time
Round) and aims to maximize battery life, even though the original was
already very good in that regard.
